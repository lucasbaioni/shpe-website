    <h3>
      Mission Statement
    </h3>

    <p>
      The University of Michigan SHPE Chapter’s mission is in accordance with the
      commitment of the national organization: to <strong>serve</strong> and
      <strong>empower</strong> the Hispanic Engineering community; to
      <strong>promote</strong> Academic Excellence, Professional and Personal
      Development, Leadership, and Service. We strive to achieve our mission by
      increasing educational opportunities, promoting professional and personal
      growth, carrying out our social responsibility to be involved in education,
      business and government issues enhancing pride within our organization, and
      reinforcing our reputation as a vital Hispanic organization.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Four Pillars
    </h3>

    <strong>
      Familia
    </strong>

    <br>

    <p>
      Our people are what have defined us for generations. Establishing a family
      away from home is essential.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>
      Service
    </strong>

    <br>

    <p>
      Community is what drives the Latinx spirit. It is our duty as an
      organization to give back.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>
      Education
    </strong>

    <br>

    <p>
      We go to school to learn! SHPE empowers students to pursue knowledge and
      achieve the unimaginable.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>
      Resilience
    </strong>

    <br>

    <p>
      Overcoming obstacles is a skill all minority groups must focus on. If
      knocked down, we get back up together.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Our History
    </h3>

    <em>
      SHPE was founded in 1974 in Los Angeles by a group of Engineers. The goal
      of the organization was to create an organization of role models to the
      Hispanic community. Here, we share our history under three different lenses:
      the national, regional, and chapter level.
    </em>

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>
      National:
    </strong>

    <br>

    <p>
      Since its creation, SHPE has grown to include over 10,000 students
      nationwide and over 225 chapters across universities. It is here that the
      original pillars of familia, service, education, and resilience were
      established! But despite this unprecedented progress, in 2011, Hispanics
      made up only 7% of 7.2 million STEM employees indicating that there is
      still a lot of work to be done.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>
      Regional:
    </strong>

    <br>

    <p>
      The state of Michigan is part of SHPE’s Region VI. This region includes
      Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin,
      alongside us. It is comprised of 1387 students and 479 professional
      members. Membership in the organization provides students several
      opportunities and benefits including access to a variety of scholarships,
      internship, fellowship, co-op opportunities, networking opportunities, and
      many more.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>
      Chapter:
    </strong>

    <br>
    <p>
      The University of Michigan Chapter began in 1989 with a small group of
      students. Since 2010, the chapter has tripled in size and the increased
      membership trend is still continuing. SHPE UM looks to provide its members
      with the skills they need to be successful, both in the workplace and the
      classroom, while helping make a big university feel small—through
      establishing a true sense of community.
