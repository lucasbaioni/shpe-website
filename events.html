    <em>
      Our first event of the year, any companies who will be helping us teach a
      voyage or practical, partaking in a tech talk or switch-up, are invited to
      attend our inaugural dinner! By highlighting some of our top corporate
      partners, and foreshadowing a few events later on in the year, we hope to
      build excitement at the meeting that, historically, always gathers the

    Corporate Diversity Mixer: 9/15/2019

    <br>

    Cost: $500

    <br>

    <em>
      At the grand career fair, it can be stressful to accurately gauge
      recruitment candidates; with 30 second pitch exchanges and hasty resume
      overviews, we’ve noted that it can be tough for either party to genuinely
      interact with one another. Our staple event of the Fall, the Diversity
      Mixer, enables companies to get more dedicated facetime with both SHPE
      and NSBE students, at our own private, mini career fair. Taking place the
      day before the college-wide event, this chance to mingle has proven to be
      our most popular opportunity for companies, over the years. Held in the
      stunning Lurie Engineering Center, we host over 25 firms every Fall, for
      this unique chance to scope out minority talent. Two payments of $500 each
      must be made out to both the SHPE & NSBE Organizations

      Interviews can be challenging, especially for students with little
      experience, or who grew up speaking English as a second language. In this
      two-day workshop, we break the ice surrounding four primary interview
      types: behavioral, case, coding, and technical. Starting off with an
      overview of what to expect with each category, followed by smaller breakout
      sessions for students to hone in on one or two specific skill sets. Day two
      will allow students to put what they’ve learned to the test, as we schedule
      mock interviews led by recruiters, the professional team, and the executive
      board. Following each interview, we will allow for a brief feedback period
      to glean a few points of advice.
